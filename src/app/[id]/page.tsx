      Tropea, Italy: A Spectacularly Situated Beach Town
      Beaches, Italy,

        Off the Beaten Path
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      Tropea Italy is one of the most spectacular seaside towns in the Mediterranean — yet it’s almost undiscovered by tourists outside Europe. Italian tourists, however, have been in the loop for quite some time.
I recently visited Tropea for the first time, on a long weekend trip exploring the region of Calabria. People say that Tropea is the jewel of Calabria, the Pearl of the Tyrrhenian Sea, and I’m inclined to agree. It’s far and away the most visually 
spectacular destination in the region!
A lot of travelers think that the Amalfi Coast is a good spot for an Italian beach destination — but I strongly disagree with this. The Amalfi Coast is gorgeous, but the beaches are tiny, often with dark gray sand, and can’t accommodate many people. If you want “beach time” in Amalfi, you’re better off booking a hotel with a pool.
Instead, Tropea is a much better version of what an Amalfi Coast beach vacation is. You still get stunning scenery — an old town perched on top of dramatic cliffs. But here you also get large, sandy beaches with plenty of room to enjoy them. Best of all? It’s significantly cheaper than the Amalfi Coast.

      Guanajuato, city, capital of Guanajuato estado (state), central Mexico. Situated on the Mesa Central, it is spread over steep hillsides at the junction of three ravines at an average elevation of about 6,725 feet (2,050 meters) above sea level.
Guanajuato was founded in 1554 and given city status in 1741. Along with Zacatecas, Mexico, to the north, and Potosí, Bolivia, the town became one of the three greatest silver-mining centers of the 16th century. Its celebrated Veta Madre (“Mother Lode”) was described as the richest in the world. The fabulous wealth was most manifest in the elaborate and richly endowed churches of San Francisco (1671) and San Diego (1663). Guanajuato’s historic city center and nearby colonial-era mines—including a shaft some 2,000 feet (600 meters) deep known as the Boca del Infierno (“Mouth of Hell”)—were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988.
Guanajuato was the first major city to fall to the independence leader Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla in 1810. The plundering and destruction that accompanied the overrunning of the Alhóndiga de Granaditas were followed by struggles for control of the city. By 1822 mineral output had slowed because of violence, floods, and the exodus of many wealthy families. Guanajuato entered a period of decline that continued until the mid-20th century, when increased tourism and federal support for mining began to increase. Yet it has remained overshadowed by the state’s larger cities, notably León with more than 10 times the capital’s population.

      Northern Sicily’s seven volcanic Aeolian Islands

        volcanic Aeolian Islands
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      Where are the Aeolian Islands? Also known as the Lipari Islands, they are part of one of Sicily's three archipelagos, the other two being the Egadi and Pelagie Islands.
They are found in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, up off the northern Sicilian coast and opposite the Tyrrhenian coast of Messina. They belong to the metropolitan city of Messina.
The seven islands are: Lipari, Salina, Vulcano, Stromboli with the Strombolicchio islet, Filicudi, Alicudi, and Panarea with the islets of Basiluzzo, Dattilo and Lisca Bianca.
The Aeolian Islands were submarine volcanoes that emerged from the waters around 700,000 years ago. Subsequent eruptions over the millennia have led to the formation of pumice stone and obsidian, which, being so sharp, is perfect for making tools. The export of obsidian throughout the Mediterranean brought great prosperity to the archipelago.

      Greenland
       
       
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      Most of the population is concentrated on the southern and central west coast — the most 
      populated city is the capital, Nuuk, with a population of about 19,000.
Yes, you can fly to Greenland. Air Greenland is a real airline flying from Copenhagen, Denmark. 
Icelandair flies to Greenland from Reykjavík, Iceland.
However, while there are roads within Greenlandic cities and towns, there are no roads connecting these 
towns. The only way to get from town to town is by plane or by boat. Air Greenland has small planes 
connecting these cities; the various boat lines are much smaller than you’d guess.

      Iceland
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
      Iceland is a small island nation that is Europe's westernmost country and home to the world’s northernmost capital, Reykjavik. Eleven percent of the country is covered in glacial ice and is surrounded by water. If global warming continues, rising water levels and melting ice could be devastating to Iceland.

A volcanic island, Iceland experiences severe volcanic activity. In 2010, the Eyjafjallajokull volcano at an elevation of 5,466 feet (1,666 meters) erupted, blowing ash high into the atmosphere and disrupting European air traffic for weeks.

Iceland is located between the Greenland Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean. It is northwest of the United Kingdom, and is slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky.

The land is plateau with mountain peaks, and ice fields, with a coastline marked by fjords, which are deep inlets carved by glaciers.
